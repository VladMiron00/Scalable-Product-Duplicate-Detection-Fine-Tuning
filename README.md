# Scalable-Product-Duplicate-Detection-Fine-Tuning

This code was written in collaboration with Lorenz Kremer for the course Computer Science for Business Analytics (FEM21037) at Erasmus University Rotterdam.

The results are obtained running Python 3.9.6.

"Main.py" needs to be ran. In said script the method of calculating the distance between duplicate clusters, the epsilon threshold stopping criteria set for within-cluster dissimilarity, and the regex corresponding to our method and MSMP+ can be found.

"TVs-all-merged_cleaned.json" is the input used for "Main.py". Is is a modified version of the original input file, where data cleaning measures have been applied as described in the paper.
